Review
The car was delivered 2 hours late and smelled bad.
Amazing service! The car was clean and staff were friendly.
I was overcharged despite booking in advance.
The AC wasn't working and the engine was noisy.
Quick pickup and return. Very smooth experience.
Support staff were rude when I asked for help.
Car was dirty and had scratches on the door.
Very happy with the rental process. No issues at all.
